# Future Electricity Consumption Prediction
This project explores future electricity consumption trends in the U.S., addressing concerns like overexploitation and air pollution. The focus is on the American Electric Power company, covering the East U.S., employing data cleaning and feature engineering steps. Through exploratory data analysis and time series analysis, various forecasting models are applied, with Seasonal and Holtâ€™s damped models showing optimal performance. The study predicts 2022 energy usage using ARIMA, highlighting winter peaks and the impact of temperature on consumption.
